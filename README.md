# Props - Simple Online Grocery Store

Create a simple online grocery store with reusable React function components. Your store should provide users with at least four buttons for possible items they can purchase. Every time a user clicks on a button, it should alert that the thing they’ve clicked on has been added to the cart via an alert message.

1) Click on the folder icon next to the **App.js** file and create a **GroceryItem.js** file.
2) Define a `GroceryItem` function component.
3) The component should accept props and return a button that displays the grocery item’s name and contain an event handler for the `onClick` event.
4) The component should be used to render the four grocery items, passing in the appropriate props.
5) In **App.js**, return four instances of the `GroceryItem` component with names such as `Eggs`, `Banana`, `Strawberry`, or `Bread`. The items are up to you!
